# Optics Github Repository
## Prof. Jacob Khurgin, Johns Hopkins University

Congratulations on being one of few to stumble upon this page on the internet.  Whether or not that's lucky is TBD.
This repository has all the lecture notes from the courses Introduction to Optics and Advanced Optical and Optoelectronic Instruments and Devices as well as final presentations/papers from recent years.  Enjoy at your leisure :D.
